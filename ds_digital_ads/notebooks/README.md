## ðŸ““ Twitter EDA

The notebook `twitter_eda.ipynb` contains the exploratory data analysis of the twitter gambling data. It explores:

- the distribution of the tweets over time
- some baseline methods to flag tweets as an 'ad' or not

You will first need to install the tesseract library to run the notebook. To install the `tesseract` library, run the following command in your terminal:

(assuming you have `brew` installed)

```bash
brew install tesseract
```
